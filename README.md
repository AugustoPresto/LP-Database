## Storing my beloved LPs
Music is one of my passions, and I like to have a physical approach. That's why I collect vinyls :)
So I decided to use some of my new skills to create a LP database to store info about my collection instead of looking for each of them individually or searching on the web. It's a terminal-based Ruby app using MVC framework with just one model, LP. ðŸŽµ

Each LP has:
ID,
Artist name,
Title,
Year,
Price (because who knows how much my beloved ones will cost?).
